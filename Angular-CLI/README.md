# Chrome Debugging with Angular CLI

by [Anthony Sneed (@tonysneed)](https://github.com/tonysneed)

This recipe shows how to use the [Debugger for Chrome](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug) extension with VS Code to debug
an application generated by the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

## Getting Started

- Make sure to have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) installed in its default location.

- Make sure to have version **3.1.4** or greater of the [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) extension  installed in VS Code.

- Use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to install Angular CLI globally.

    ```
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

- Use Angular CLI to create a new Angular application.

    ```
    ng new my-dream-app
    ```

- Change to the newly created application directory and open VS Code.

    ```
    cd my-dream-app
    code .
    ```

## Configure launch.json File

- Click on the Debugging icon in the Activity Bar to bring up the Debug view.
Then click on the gear icon to configure a launch.json file, selecting **Chrome** for the environment:

- Replace content of the generated launch.json with the following two configurations:

  ```json
  {
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "type": "chrome",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch Chrome with ng serve",
        "url": "http://localhost:4200/#",
        "webRoot": "${workspaceRoot}"
      },
      {
        "type": "chrome",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch Chrome with ng test",
        "url": "http://localhost:9876/debug.html",
        "webRoot": "${workspaceRoot}"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## Start Debugging

- Set a breakpoint in **app.component.ts** on the line that sets the `title` property of `AppComponent`.

- Open a terminal at the root folder and serve the app using Angular CLI:

  ```
  ng serve
  ```

- Go to the Debug view, select the **'Launch Chrome with ng serve'** configuration, then press F5 or click the green play button.

- The app will be shown in a browser, but in order to hit the breakpoint you'll need to *refresh* the browser.

## Debug Unit Tests

- Set a breakpoint in **app.component.spec.ts** on a line in one of the unit tests.

- Open a terminal at the root folder and run the tests using Angular CLI:

  ```
  ng test
  ```

- After the test run, go to the Debug view, select the **'Launch Chrome with ng test'** configuration, then press F5 or click the green button.

- When a browser opens with the test list, click the link for the test in which you placed the breakpoint. You should then hit the breakpoint:
