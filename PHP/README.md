# PHP Debugging with PHP Debug and XDebug

by [Luiz Barni (@odahcam)](https://github.com/odahcam)

This recipe shows how to use the [PHP Debug](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug) extension with VS Code to debug PHP code with XDebug.

## Getting Started

**Fistly we you gotta install [XDebug](https://xdebug.org).**

### Installing XDebug

Let's to this by following the [PHP Debug](https://github.com/felixfbecker/vscode-php-debug) insctructions:

> If you have `pecl` enabled, you can install XDebug via `pecl install xdebug` and jump to step 3.

1. [Install XDebug](https://xdebug.org/docs/install)
    **_I highly recommend you make a simple `test.php` file, put a `phpinfo();` statement in there, then copy the output and paste it into the [XDebug installation wizard](https://xdebug.org/wizard.php). It will analyze it and give you tailored installation instructions for your environment._** In short:
    - On Windows: [Download](https://xdebug.org/download.php) the appropiate precompiled DLL for your PHP version, architecture (64/32 Bit), thread safety (TS/NTS) and Visual Studio compiler version and place it in your PHP extension folder.
    - On Linux: Either download the source code as a tarball or [clone it with git](https://xdebug.org/docs/install#source), then [compile it](https://xdebug.org/docs/install#compile).

2. [Configure PHP to use XDebug](https://xdebug.org/docs/install#configure-php) by adding `zend_extension=path/to/xdebug` to your php.ini. The path of your php.ini is shown in your `phpinfo()` output under "Loaded Configuration File".

3. Enable remote debugging in your php.ini:

    ```ini
    [XDebug]
    xdebug.remote_enable = 1
    xdebug.remote_autostart = 1
    ```

    There are other ways to tell XDebug to connect to a remote debugger than `remote_autostart`, like cookies, query parameters or browser extensions. I recommend `remote_autostart` because it "just works". There are also a variety of other options, like the port (by default 9000), please see the [XDebug documentation on remote debugging](https://xdebug.org/docs/remote#starting) for more information.

4. If you are doing web development, don't forget to restart your webserver to reload the settings.

5. Verify your installation by checking your `phpinfo()` output for an XDebug section.

### Installing PHP Debug

We got some options for doing this here:

- Via CLI: `code --install-extension felixfbecker.php-debug`.

- Via VSCode's extension menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>): search for `felixfbecker.php-debug`.

- Via VSCode extension store: go to [PHP Debug in VSCode store](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug) and click the "Install" button.

## Configure `launch.json` File

Click on the Debugging icon in the Activity Bar to bring up the Debug view. Then click on the gear icon to configure a `launch.json` file, selecting **PHP** for the environment:

`launch.json` ready!

## Create a simple PHP file

Now that we have everything configured let's just create a test file called `index.php`:

```php
<?php

echo 'Hello new world!';
```

## Start Debugging

- Set a breakpoint in **index.php** on the line 3 (`echo`'s line).

- Launch a PHP server for the file.

  ```bash
  php -S localhost:4000 index.php
  ```

  > The `localhost`'s port (`4000`) can be anything you want.

- Go to the Debug view, select the **"Listen for XDebug"** configuration, then press F5 or click the green play button.

- Open the browser in [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
